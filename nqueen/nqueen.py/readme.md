# ðŸ§¬ N-Queens Solver using Genetic Algorithm

This is a Python project that solves the classic **N-Queens Problem** using a **Genetic Algorithm**.  
It was created as part of a lab assignment by a first-year CSE student.

## ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement

Place **N queens** on an **NÃ—N chessboard** in such a way that **no two queens attack each other**.  
That means no two queens should be in the same **row**, **column**, or **diagonal**.

## ðŸ§  Solution Approach: Genetic Algorithm

The Genetic Algorithm (GA) is inspired by natural selection.  
It works with a population of possible solutions and evolves better ones over time using:

- **Fitness Function** â€“ to evaluate how good a solution is
- **Selection** â€“ to pick the best candidates
- **Crossover** â€“ to combine two parents into one child
- **Mutation** â€“ to add randomness and improve diversity

## ðŸ§ª How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed.
2. Clone this repo or download the `.py` file.
3. Run the program using:

```bash
python n_queens_ga.py
```
