# 🐍 Python Basics – First Year Student Projects

Welcome to my beginner-level Python programs! 👨‍💻  
These small projects were created as part of my first-year Computer Science practice. Each program solves a basic problem using fundamental Python concepts like loops, conditions, functions, and lists.

   - Sums all numbers between 50 and 100 that are divisible by 3 but **not** divisible by 5.

4. **Find the Second Highest Number**
   - Sorts a list and prints the second highest number.

5. **Factorial Using For Loop**
   - Takes a number as input and prints its factorial using a `for` loop.

6. **Generate Fibonacci Series**
   - Prints a Fibonacci sequence of `n` terms using iteration.

7. **Find Largest Between Two Numbers (Using Function)**
